# Defines the data disks to use.
# The name and mount point association is relevant for parity, do not change it
# WARNING: Adding here your /home, /var or /tmp disks is NOT a good idea!
# SnapRAID is better suited for files that rarely changes!
# e.g.
# snapraid_data_disks:
#   - name: data1

#   - name: data2
#     path: /mnt/data2
#     smartctl_options: -d usbjmicron %s

# Defines the disks to use as parity storage.
# It must NOT be a data disk
# If more than one parity disk is specified, they enable the multiple failures
# protection from two to six level of parity.

# snapraid_parity_disks:
#   - path: /mnt/parity1
#   - path: /mnt/parity2
#     smartctl_options: -d areca,1/1 /dev/sg0

# Defines the files to use as content list
# You must have least one copy for each parity file plus one. Some more don't hurt
# They can be in the disks used for data, parity or boot, but each file must be
# in a different disk
# e.g.
# snapraid_content_files:
#   - /mnt/data1/snapraid.content

# Defines the hash size in bytes.
# WARNING: Changing this value is for experts only!
# snapraid_hashsize: 16

# Automatically save the state when syncing after the specified amount
# of GB processed.
# This option is useful to avoid to restart from scratch long 'sync'

# It also improves the recovering if a disk break during a 'sync'.

# Defines the pooling directory where the virtual view of the disk
# array is created using the "pool" command.
# The files are not really copied here, but just linked using
